# Clinomania
⚠️**The project is currently under development**

Clinomania is a way for customers to connect with repair/service personnel. Geared towards homeowners, think of this as Uber for servicepersons.

## User Flow

### For customers
Open the app and Sign In. Fill in details about your job requirements and attach a photo of the situation. Send it and wait for someone to respond.

### For servicepersons
Receive a notification about a work order in the area. Alternatively, browse through available listings in the Jobs tab. Accept the job and navigate to the location.
Attach a photo after job completion and mark the ticket as "done".


## Development

The work will happen in phases. Details about the phases will be added progressively.
